Below are the **detailed setup instructions** for the entire process of setting up and deploying the **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Model** for a **QA Bot** with a **Gradio frontend** interface.

---

### Part 1: Setting Up the Colab Notebook for RAG Model

This part focuses on setting up the environment in **Google Colab**, installing dependencies, and writing the code to integrate Pinecone, Cohere, and other necessary libraries.

#### Step 1: Install Required Dependencies

To begin, we need to install the required Python libraries for embedding generation, document retrieval, and generative models.

1. **Install Dependencies in Colab**:
   Run the following in a Colab code cell to install necessary libraries.
   
   ```bash
   !pip install pinecone-client cohere transformers gradio
   ```

2. **Import Required Libraries**:
   In your Colab notebook, import the required libraries.
   
   ```python
   import pinecone
   import cohere
   from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModel
   import torch
   import gradio as gr
   ```

3. **Set Up Pinecone**:
   Initialize the Pinecone client with your API key, and create or connect to your Pinecone index.
   
   ```python
   pinecone.init(api_key='your_pinecone_api_key')
   index = pinecone.Index("document-qa")  # Create the index or connect to an existing one
   ```

4. **Set Up Cohere**:
   Initialize the Cohere client using your API key.
   
   ```python
   co = cohere.Client('your_cohere_api_key')
   ```

5. **Embedding Model**:
   Load a pre-trained model for embedding generation (we’re using a sentence transformer model here).
   
   ```python
   tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   model = AutoModel.from_pretrained('sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
   ```

6. **Embedding Generation Function**:
   Define a function to generate embeddings from text.
   
   ```python
   def embed_text(text):
       tokens = tokenizer(text, return_tensors="pt", padding=True, truncation=True)
       with torch.no_grad():
           embeddings = model(**tokens).last_hidden_state[:, 0, :]
       return embeddings.mean(dim=0).numpy()
   ```

7. **Text Extraction from PDFs**:
   Add a placeholder function for extracting text from PDF documents. You can use libraries like `PyMuPDF` or `PyPDF2` for actual extraction.
   
   ```python
   def extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file):
       # Replace this placeholder with actual code to extract text from the PDF
       return "Extracted text from the PDF document."
   ```

8. **Answer Generation**:
   Write a function to retrieve relevant documents from Pinecone and generate answers using the Cohere API.
   
   ```python
   def generate_answer(query, similar_docs):
       document_content = " ".join([doc['metadata']['text'] for doc in similar_docs])
       response = co.generate(prompt=f"Based on the following content: {document_content}, answer the question: {query}")
       return response.generations[0].text
   ```

#### Step 2: Running the Code in Colab

1. Once all functions are defined, you can run your Colab notebook. The notebook will:
   - Allow document embeddings to be stored in Pinecone.
   - Enable querying the embeddings with a user-provided question.
   - Use Cohere to generate a response based on the retrieved documents.

### Part 2: Interactive QA Bot Interface (Gradio)

Next, you will build a frontend interface using **Gradio**. The interface allows users to upload documents, ask questions, and retrieve answers.

#### Step 1: Set Up Gradio Interface

1. **Upload and Answer Function**:
   Create a function that processes the PDF file, extracts text, retrieves embeddings, and answers the question.
   
   ```python
   def upload_and_answer(pdf_file, query):
       # Extract text from the PDF
       extracted_text = extract_text_from_pdf(pdf_file)
   
       # Embed the extracted text and upsert into Pinecone
       doc_embedding = embed_text(extracted_text)
       index.upsert([('uploaded_doc', doc_embedding)])
   
       # Process the query to retrieve similar documents
       query_embedding = embed_text(query)
       response = index.query(query_embedding, top_k=1)
       similar_docs = response['matches']
   
       # Generate the answer based on the retrieved documents
       answer = generate_answer(query, similar_docs)
       return answer
   ```

2. **Gradio Interface**:
   Create the Gradio interface that allows users to upload a PDF and ask a question.

   ```python
   iface = gr.Interface(fn=upload_and_answer, 
                        inputs=[gr.inputs.File(type="file"), gr.inputs.Textbox(label="Ask a question")], 
                        outputs="text", 
                        title="Document-based QA Bot",
                        description="Upload a PDF document and ask questions based on its content.")
   iface.launch()
   ```

3. **Run Gradio**:
   This will launch the Gradio interface, where users can interact with the system by uploading PDFs and asking questions.

#### Step 2: Interact with the Application

1. **Upload a PDF**: Users can upload a PDF document containing relevant information.
2. **Ask a Question**: Users type in their question, and the backend logic retrieves relevant information from the uploaded document and generates an answer.

### Part 3: Deployment Instructions

Once your Colab notebook and Gradio interface are ready, you can deploy the entire system either locally or to the cloud for production use.

#### Step 1: Deploying the Colab Notebook to GitHub

1. **Save the Notebook**: In Colab, save the notebook with a name like `QA_Bot.ipynb`.
   
2. **Push to GitHub**:
   - Install Git in the Colab environment (if not already installed).
   
     ```bash
     !apt-get install git
     ```

   - Configure your Git settings.
   
     ```bash
     !git config --global user.name "Your Name"
     !git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
     ```

   - Clone your GitHub repository.
   
     ```bash
     !git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
     ```
   
   - Move your notebook into the repository folder and push it to GitHub.
   
     ```bash
     !mv QA_Bot.ipynb YOUR_REPOSITORY/
     %cd YOUR_REPOSITORY/
     !git add QA_Bot.ipynb
     !git commit -m "Added QA Bot notebook"
     !git push https://YOUR_GITHUB_TOKEN@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPOSITORY.git
     ```

#### Step 2: Deploying the Gradio Interface

You can deploy the **Gradio** interface in a variety of ways, depending on your preference:

1. **Run Locally**: You can run the Gradio interface on your local machine by running the code directly in Python. Simply run:
   
   ```bash
   python your_script.py
   ```

2. **Deploy Using Google Colab**: Gradio provides a URL when launched inside Colab, which can be accessed from anywhere. The deployment URL is shown after you call `iface.launch()`.

3. **Docker Deployment**:
   - Create a `Dockerfile` for your Gradio app, specifying all necessary dependencies.
   
     ```Dockerfile
     FROM python:3.9
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt
     RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
     COPY . .
     CMD ["python", "your_gradio_script.py"]
     ```
   
   - Build the Docker image and push it to a cloud provider like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Heroku**.

4. **Deploy Using Streamlit Sharing**: If you’re using **Streamlit** instead of Gradio, you can deploy the app using **Streamlit Cloud** (streamlit.io/sharing) for free hosting of the app.
